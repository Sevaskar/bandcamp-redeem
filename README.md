# Bandcamp Code Redemption Website

This project allows Bandcamp followers to redeem codes for my music releases. 
It ensures each user can only redeem a code once per title.

## Features
- List all available music titles
- Allow users to redeem a code for each title
- Prevent duplicate redemptions
- Encourage users to leave a comment on Bandcamp

## How It Works
1. Users log in with their Bandcamp account.
2. They select a title and redeem a code.
3. The system verifies the redemption and updates the database.

## Technologies Used
- GitHub Pages (Hosting)
- Google Sheets (Code Storage)
- Google Apps Script (Backend)
- HTML, JavaScript (Frontend)
